#   Example:
#           true (The message is displayed in the chat when the player enters)
#           false (The message does not appear)
#
#   Default: true
#

IndividualXp.Announce = true

#
#   IndividualXp.AnnounceRatesOnLogin
#
#   Description: The player is shown the rates he has and the maximum value when he enters the chat
#   Example:
#           true (The message is displayed in the chat when the player enters)

#   IndividualXp.MaxXPRate
#
#   Description: This is the max amount a player can set their xp to.
#   Example: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 (Any positive integer you want)
#

#
#   IndividualXp.DefaultXPRate
#
#   Description: This is the default rate players start with.
#   Recommendation: It might be a good idea to set the default value to the maximum.
#   Then each player can choose whether to lower it or not. Although it could also be 1.
#
#   Default: 1
#

IndividualXp.DefaultXPRate = 1

#
#   IndividualXp.MaxLevel
#
#   Description: The level at which a player's XP rate is automatically reset to 1x.
#                This acts as a global default. A per-player level cap can also be set
#                by a GM using the in-game command: .xp setplayer <name> <rate> <maxlevel>
#                A per-player value always takes priority over this global setting.
#   Example:
#           0  (Disabled - XP rate never resets based on level)
#           60 (XP rate resets to 1x when the player reaches level 60)
#
#   Default: 0
#

IndividualXp.MaxLevel = 0
